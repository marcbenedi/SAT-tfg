\section{Tools}
In this chapter the development tools for this project will be introduced. 
\subsection{Git}
\href{https://git-scm.com/}{Git} is a well known version control system developed by Linus Torvalds\footnote{Linux creator. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds}{(more)}}.\\
Git will be used in this project because it allows to maintain a tracking of all the changes made (commits), and what is more important, return to them at any time. In addition to this, it enforces a short cycle development (because commits are small units of work) and the developer has to document them.
