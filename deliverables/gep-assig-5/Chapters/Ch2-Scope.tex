\begin{itemize}
	\item GEP
	\item Initial Stage\\
	In this stage, the previous code will be tested and refactored\footnote{Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code—changing the factoring—without changing its external behaviour. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring}{(more)}} to assure a solid base and the requirements and architecture of the system will be defined.
	\item Iteration 1: Pseudo-boolean minimization\\
	This iteration will be for the first objective: Pseudo-boolean minimization. In this stage we will work with PBLib, first adding a layer between the user and PBLib to make it more user-firendly and implementing search strategies to find the minimum value.
	\item Iteration 2: Timeout\\
	This iteration will be for the second objective: Timeout
	\item Iteration 3: Multithreading (Optional)\\
	This iteration will be for the third objective: Multi-threading. Here, some existing SAT solver will be modified to support multithreading techniques.
	\item Final stage\\
	In this stage, all possible bugs will be solved and feedback from the supervisor will be taken. Also, the final document and presentation will be finished.
