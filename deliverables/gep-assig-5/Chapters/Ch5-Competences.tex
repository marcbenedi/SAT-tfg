\emph{Comment: In the inscription of the TFG, the competence CCO2.1 is selected. This was an error during the inscription process. The correct one is the competence CCO3.1 and it is the one which is explained in this deliverable. }
\section{CCO1.1  Evaluate the complexity of a problem, know algorithm strategies which could solve them, and recommend, develop and implement the solution which assures the best performance according to the established requirements. [Enough]}
As previously explained, the topic of this project, pseudo-boolean minimization, is NP-Complete. The second and the third objectives of this project require modifying existing software, for example, a SAT solver. For this, it is a must to understand the algorithms implemented and modify them in the correct way. 

\section{CCO3.1	 Implement code with critical requirements in execution time, efficiency and security. [Enough]}
Because the goal of this project is to reduce the execution time for this problem, execution time and efficiency are critical requirements of the solution which will be implemented.
