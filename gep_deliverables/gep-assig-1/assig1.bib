@article{Abio,
	abstract = {Pseudo-Boolean constraints are omnipresent in practical ap-plications, and therefore a significant effort has been devoted to the de-velopment of good SAT encoding techniques for these constraints. Sev-eral of these encodings are based on building Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) and translating these into CNF. Indeed, BDD-based encodings have important advantages, such as sharing the same BDD for repre-senting many constraints. Here we first prove that, unless NP = Co-NP, there are Pseudo-Boolean constraints that admit no variable ordering giving a polynomial (Re-duced, Ordered) BDD. As far as we know, this result is new (in spite of some misleading information in the literature). It gives several interesting insights, also relating proof complexity and BDDs. But, more interestingly for practice, here we also show how to overcome this theoretical limitation by coefficient decomposition. This allows us to give the first polynomial arc-consistent BDD-based encoding for Pseudo-Boolean constraints.},

Here we show that by using the right distribution of instances, and appropriate parameter values, it is possible to generate random formulas that are hard, that is, for which satisfiability testing is quite difficult. Our results provide a benchmark for the evalua-tion of satisfiability-testing procedures.},

In this work we present a novel small sized and simple to implement encoding. The encoding maintains generalized arc consistency by unit propagation and results in a linear sized formula in conjunctive normal form with respect to the number of input variables. Experimental data confirms the advantages of the encoding over existing ones for most of the relevant PB instances.},

@article{Steinke2015,
	abstract = {Many different encodings for PB constraints into conjunctive normal form (CNF) have been proposed in the past. The PBLib project starts to collect and implement these encodings to be able to encode PB constraints in a very simple, but effective way. The aim is not only to generate as few clauses as possible, but also using encodings that maintain generalized arc consistency by unit propagation, to speedup the run time of the SAT solver, solving the formula. A major issue of the implementation is a high flexibility for the user. Consequently it is not required to bring a PB constraint into a certain normal form. The PBLib automatically normalizes the constraints and decides which encoder provides the most effective translation. The user can also define constraints with two comparators (less equal and greater equal) and each PB constraint can be encoded in an incre-mental way: After an initial encoding it is possible to add a tighter bound with only a few additional clauses. This mechanism allows the user to develop SAT-based solvers for optimization problems with incremental strengthening and to keep the learned clauses for incremental SAT solver calls.},
