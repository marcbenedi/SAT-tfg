\chapter{Computer Science Adequacy}

\label{Chapter4} 

This project allows me to apply a lot of things learned in the speciality.\\
The topic of this project, SAT, is a well known NP-Complete problem. One of the requirements to work on it is understand how to evaluate hardness of the problems and, for example, what NP-Complete means. Also, know how the problem is solved nowadays and how the solutions are implemented. This knowledge will allow the modification of this solutions and apply parallelism to it. 

As the main goal of this project is trying to reduce solving time it is very important to know how to develop efficient algorithms with critical requirements in reliability and efficiency. 

Also, the topic of the project is hardly related to Computer Science. It is widely used in other subjects such as artificial intelligence, circuit design, \ldots
