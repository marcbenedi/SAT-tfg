The courses which will influence more this project are the following ones.\\

\section{Informatics Logic}

The main topic of this project, Pseudo-boolean minimization, is very related to Informatics Logic.

Informatics Logic taught me the tools and the knowledge to be able to do this project. What is SAT, a logic, a CNF, a BDD, \ldots

Without this course, this project could not be done.

\section{Algorithms}

This course taught me different types of programming such as Dynamic programming and some advanced data structures. With this tools, more efficient algorithms will be developed in this project. \\\\\\
Another course will influence this TFG. It is not from CS speciality but it is worth to mention:
\section{Parallelism}
In this course, I learned to identify which parts of an algorithm are parallelisable and how to find the best performance. This course will be useful for the last iteration, apply multithreading on the program.
